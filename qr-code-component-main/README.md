## My process

My process was simple, i built the build blocks of the html such as the various divs and then just coded the css for the main qr code component!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As it was a simple challenge i used the prior knowledge i have to complete it, so nothing learned this time but it's always fun writing css to put the block in places!
